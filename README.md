# Kevin Chen's Website

Built mostly from scratch, with much work put into CSS styling. I took this site as a chance to have some fun with front end development.

## Imports
 * Bootstrap (mostly for the columns)
 * jQuery Easing (for the slick scroll animation)

## Inspirations
 * codyhouse.co (specifically, [Secondary Fixed Navigation](http://codyhouse.co/gem/secondary-fixed-navigation/))

## Icons
I made fairly significant edits, but the original navigational icons all come from the Noun Project.
* Speech Bubble by Rabee Balakrishnan
* Rocket by Netanel Koso
* genius by Vicons Design
* Book by Christopher T. Howlett
* contact by Evan Shuster

## My To-do List
 * Properly handle caching
 * Optimize images and sizes
