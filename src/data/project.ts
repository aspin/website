      "Trader API integrates popular decentralized exchange applications into" +

      "their own blockchain infrastructure and puzzle out the complexities of " +
      "decoding blockchain state.",
      "I ran the team that developed this API, which integrated with projects such " +
      "as Openbook, Jupiter, Drift, CronFi, etc. Initially, this API was built " +
      "with a focus on Solana, but eventually expanded to cover Ethereum exchanges as well. " +
      "Aside from the API, I also created open-source SDKs in various languages, and " +
      "contributed to a number of other projects to improve Solana support.",
      "Probably the most interesting facet of this project was handling the " +
      "sheer volume of data from Solana blockchain (100s of MBs per second) and" +
      " figuring out how to transform that information into useful notifications " +
      "and updates for traders."
