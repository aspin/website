        Hi there! I'm Kevin and I'm a software engineer.

        I'm currently a tech lead / engineering manager at a bloXroute Labs. I
        lead a team of blockchain experts that focus on integrating a variety of
        cross-chain (most commonly Solana and Ethereum) DeFi projects with
        networking infrastructure powered by the BDN.

        My technical interests generally relate to expanding generalizable
        knowledge. For me, this usually takes the form of technical research
        (I've conducted and published research; see projects for more details)
        and contributing to open-source. I've submitted issues and PRs to a
        number of open-source projects and almost always open up my personal
        projects in case someone else on the internet can find something
        educational. I always particularly savor job-related tasks that involve
        contributing some knowledge back to any open-source community.

        I prefer programming to managing, but I take managerial responsibilities
        seriously and think of them as hard work. In my role, I see myself as
        responsible for facilitating for a team of proficient developers and
        advocating for strong work-life balance. One strong opinion I have is
        that requiring unwanted evening or weekend development a sign that I am
        not doing my job correctly in balancing my teams time against business
        needs. Simultaneously, I consider conflicts between my advocacy for what
        work my team can take against constant business asks to be a critical
        part of what makes a healthy give-and-take balance in the company.
